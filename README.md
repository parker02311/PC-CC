# Mod Importer

This mod allows you to import a Lua file containing coaster data into Planet Coaster 2.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This mod requires [ACSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetcoaster2/mods/1) to work. Make sure you have it installed before proceeding.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page]()
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file into your `Planet Coaster 2/Win64/ovldata`.

Modding is not supported by Frontier, so use this mod at your own risk. It may cause unexpected behavior in the game.

# NL2 CSV Converter

We have a website that allows you to convert NL2 CSV files to Lua files that can be imported into Planet Coaster 2.

## Usage
1. Go to the website.
2. Upload your NL2 CSV file. (If you do not own a professional copy of NL2, you can use the NL2 CSV Exporter)
3. The website will process the file and provide you with a Lua file.
4. Follow the instructions provided by the website to add the Lua file to your game.

Massive thank you to **Inaki** for the original effort to create a PC1 importer, which this mod is based on.

Another massive thank you to **Distantz** for creating the original NL2 CSV to Lua python converter which the website is based on.

And of course, thank you to **coppertime** and the rest of the modding community for their support and listening to my weeks of trying to figure out crashes.
